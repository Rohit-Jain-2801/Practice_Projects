## Dataset-
### Features:
* **fixed acidity** - most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)
* **volatile acidity** - the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste
* **citric acid** - found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines
* **residual sugar** - the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet
* **chlorides** - the amount of salt in the wine
* **free sulfur dioxide** - the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
* **total sulfur dioxide** - amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine
* **density** - the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content
* **pH** - describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale
* **sulphates** - a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
* **alcohol** - the percent alcohol content of the wine

### Target:
* **quality** - output variable (based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10)
